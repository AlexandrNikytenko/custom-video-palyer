## Custom HTML5 Video Player with Controls

This project is a custom video player built using React that enhances the native HTML5 video element by providing a custom control interface. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to implement custom controls for HTML5 video, replacing the native browser controls with a more personalized user interface.

### Features:

- **Play/Pause**: The user can toggle between playing and pausing the video by clicking either on the video itself or a custom Play/Pause button.
- **Seek Bar**: A progress bar allows the user to navigate through the video by dragging or clicking along the bar.
- **Volume Control**: A slider enables the user to adjust the video volume to their preference.
- **Fullscreen Mode**: The user can toggle fullscreen mode using a dedicated button.
- **Skip Forward/Backward**: The user can quickly skip forward or backward in the video by 10 seconds using dedicated skip buttons.
- **Playback Speed Control**: The user can modify the video playback speed, with options ranging from 0.5x to 2x.
- **Time Display**: The current playback time and total video duration are displayed in a readable format (mm:ss).

### Purpose:

This project serves as an example of how to integrate custom control elements with the native HTML5 video player, providing users with a more customizable and intuitive video playback experience. The default browser video controls are replaced with this custom implementation to offer a personalized user interface.
